# Security Information and Event Management
## SolarWinds 
Network and host intrusion detection system, which performs real-time monitoring, responding, and reporting of security threats.

# Security Orchestrated, Automation and Response (SOAR)
## Splunk
Traffic analysis tool that can perform historical searches on network traffic logs to identify traces of threats in the past as well as current threats.
# Intrusion Detection System
## OSSEC
Made of server, agent, and router monitor, which allows rootkit detection, system integrity checking, threat alerts, and response.
## Security Onion
Provides network monitoring via full packet capture, host-based and network-based intrusion detection systems, log indexing, and search and data visualization features.
## Snort 
Network intrusion prevention and intrusion detection system capable of real-time traffic analysis and logging, which uses a series of rules to identify malicious network activity, find the packets, and generate alerts.

# Password Auditing
## John the Ripper 
Password auditing, cracking, and general security tool that can crack passwords through a wide range of security protocols, transmission methods, encryption protocols, and static locations.

# Web Vulnerability
## Acunetix
Checks for surface vulnerable threats in checkout processes, shopping carts, login pages, and online forms where an attacker can submit data to a server to be processed.
## Burp Suite
Tools for debugging and testing web app security, including an intercepting proxy tool.
## Nikto
Command-line tool useful for uncovering vulnerabilities in web apps, services, and web servers such as unpatched software, misconfigurations, and other security issues.
## Nessus Professional
Vulnerability assessment tools that not only scans for issues but can fix them as well.
## ZAP 
Penetration testing tool designed specifically for testing web applications and is known as a "man-in-the-middle proxy,” where it intercepts and inspects messages sent between browsers and web applications.

# Fingerprinting and Forensics Tool
## p0f 
Can identify fingerprints and other vital information without network interference passively rather than actively, which means it's nearly impossible to detect and even harder to block.

# Encryption
## TCPCrypt 
Automatically encrypts traffic whenever it can, and if the endpoint doesn’t support encryption, it falls back to TCP traffic.

# Firewalls
## PfSense 
Firewall/router projects that can also be configured for intrusion detection and prevention, traffic shaping, load balancing, and content filtering.

# User Awareness Training Exercises
## Gophish 
Toolkit for security administrators to build their own phishing campaigns to find out who needs greater phishing awareness.

# Penetration Testing
## Aircrack-ng
Wireless tools that capture, analyze, and export packet data, spoof access points or routers, and crack complex Wi-Fi password.
## Metasploit Framework
Framework that can test computer system vulnerabilities or can be used to break into remote systems.
## Nmap
Network mapper used to find open ports, detect host devices, see which network services are active, fingerprint operating systems, and locate potential backdoors.
## OpenVAS
All-in-one vulnerability scanner that comprehensively tests for security holes, misconfigured systems, and outdated software.
## Shodan
A search engine for internet-connected devices — from routers and servers to Internet of Things (IoT) devices - and if the devices aren't protected, know to break into the network.
## Sqlmap
Penetration testing tool that automates detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws of database servers, which includes a detection engine and many niche features.
## Wireshark 
Tool to locate, identify, and examine network packets to diagnose critical issues and spot security weaknesses.
